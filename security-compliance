# **Aye — Security & Compliance**

*Last updated: January 2026*

This document describes the security architecture, privacy controls, and global compliance posture of **Aye** and its products, including **AyeFace**, a biometric-enabled payment, wallet, and loyalty platform.

Security, privacy, and regulatory compliance are foundational to Aye’s product design and operational governance.

---

## **1. Company & Product Scope**

Aye operates a technology platform that enables:

* Biometric-based user authentication (AyeFace)
* Wallet and loyalty orchestration
* Payment initiation through licensed financial institutions
* AI-driven personalization and fraud risk detection

Aye **does not operate as a bank** and **does not directly settle funds**. Payment authorization and settlement are conducted by **licensed merchant acquirers and payment service providers** in accordance with local regulations.

---

## **2. Privacy & Data Protection Framework**

### **2.1 Applicable Regulations**

Aye aligns its data protection practices with major global privacy frameworks, including:

* **EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)**
* **Malaysia Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA)**
* **Singapore Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA)**

These frameworks govern how personal data and biometric information are collected, processed, stored, transferred, and deleted.

---

### **2.2 Data Protection Principles**

Aye applies the following principles across all systems:

* **Explicit consent**, especially for biometric data
* **Purpose limitation** — data used only for defined functions
* **Data minimisation**
* **Security by design and by default**
* **User rights support** (access, correction, deletion where applicable)

---

### **2.3 Biometric Data Handling**

Biometric data is classified as **sensitive personal data**.

* Raw facial images are **not stored**
* Facial data is converted into **non-reversible mathematical templates**
* Templates are encrypted and access-controlled
* Biometric processing occurs only after **explicit user opt-in**

Biometric data is never sold, shared, or reused outside its stated purpose.

---

## **3. AI Governance & Responsible Use**

Aye uses AI to support authentication, fraud detection, and personalization.

### **3.1 AI Controls**

* Human oversight on critical decision paths
* Continuous performance and anomaly monitoring
* Audit logs for AI-driven actions
* Bias and false-acceptance monitoring for biometric systems

### **3.2 Regulatory Readiness**

Aye’s AI governance is designed to be compatible with emerging global AI regulations (e.g. risk-based AI frameworks), emphasizing:

* Transparency
* Explainability where applicable
* Accountability and traceability

---

## **4. Fintech & Payments Compliance**

### **4.1 Payment Architecture**

* Payments are executed via **licensed banks and acquirers**
* Aye acts as a **technology orchestration layer**
* No storage of card numbers or bank credentials by Aye

### **4.2 Financial Crime Risk Controls**

Aye supports ecosystem-level risk management through:

* Identity verification workflows
* Transaction anomaly detection
* Fraud pattern analysis
* Alignment with **FATF AML/CFT best practices**

Final regulatory responsibility for AML/KYC remains with licensed financial institutions.

---

## **5. Infrastructure & Cloud Security**

### **5.1 Cloud Environment**

Aye operates primarily on **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**, leveraging its enterprise-grade security capabilities.

Key controls include:

* Network segmentation and zero-trust principles
* Encryption at rest and in transit
* Identity and Access Management (IAM)
* Secure CI/CD pipelines

---

### **5.2 Google Cloud Security Command Center**

Aye uses **Google Cloud Security Command Center (SCC)** as a centralized security management platform to:

* Monitor infrastructure misconfigurations
* Detect vulnerabilities and threats
* Enforce security posture management
* Provide continuous compliance visibility

Security Command Center supports:

* Real-time asset inventory
* Automated risk findings
* Security health dashboards
* Incident prioritization and response

This enables proactive detection and remediation of cloud security risks.

---

## **6. Cryptography Standards**

Aye applies industry-recognized cryptographic standards, including:

* **AES-256** for data at rest
* **TLS 1.2 / TLS 1.3** for data in transit
* **Public-key cryptography (ECC / RSA)** for signing and authentication
* **Secure hashing (e.g., SHA-256+)** for integrity verification
* Managed **Key Management Services (KMS)** and hardware-backed protection where available

Keys are never hardcoded in application logic.

---

## **7. Blockchain-Based Security Architecture**

### **7.1 Purpose of Blockchain Usage**

Blockchain is used selectively as a **security and integrity layer**, not as a payment rail.

Primary objectives:

* Tamper-evident audit trails
* Non-repudiation of critical events
* Cross-party trust without exposing sensitive data

---

### **7.2 On-Chain vs Off-Chain Data**

**On-chain (hashed / encrypted references only):**

* Consent proofs
* Authentication or transaction event hashes
* System integrity checkpoints
* Configuration or model version fingerprints

**Never stored on-chain:**

* Biometric images or templates
* Personal Identifiable Information (PII)
* Payment credentials
* Monetary transaction values

All sensitive data remains **off-chain**, encrypted, and access-controlled.

---

### **7.3 Biometric Integrity Verification**

Blockchain enables verification that:

* A biometric template has not been altered
* User consent existed at the time of use
* Authentication events are tamper-evident

This strengthens auditability without decentralizing personal data.

---

### **7.4 Smart Contracts (If Used)**

Smart contracts are limited to:

* Event verification
* Timestamping
* Integrity validation

They **do not**:

* Authorize payments
* Move funds
* Replace regulated institutions

---

## **8. Biometric Liveness & Anti-Spoofing**

### **8.1 Tencent Liveness Detection**

Aye integrates **Tencent’s liveness detection technology** to protect against biometric spoofing attacks, including:

* Printed photos
* Screen replays
* Video injections
* Mask-based impersonation

Tencent’s liveness technology provides:

* Multi-dimensional facial analysis
* Active and passive liveness detection
* High-accuracy real-time verification

This significantly reduces false acceptance rates and enhances biometric security in real-world retail and payment environments.

---

## **9. Information Security Standards Alignment**

Aye aligns its internal controls with internationally recognized standards, including:

* **ISO/IEC 27001** — Information Security Management
* **ISO/IEC 27701** — Privacy Information Management
* **ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 37** — Biometrics standards
* Secure Software Development Lifecycle (SSDLC) practices

Formal certifications may be pursued as the organization scales.

---

## **10. Incident Response & Monitoring**

Aye maintains documented incident response procedures covering:

* Detection and containment
* Impact assessment
* Regulatory and stakeholder notification (where required)
* Root cause analysis and remediation

Security events are monitored continuously across infrastructure and application layers.

---

## **11. User & Merchant Rights**

Users and merchants are entitled to:

* Transparency on data usage
* Access and correction of personal data
* Consent withdrawal where legally applicable
* Secure deletion aligned with regulatory requirements

Requests can be submitted via official Aye support channels.

---

## **12. Continuous Compliance & Governance**

Aye maintains ongoing compliance through:

* Internal risk reviews
* Third-party security assessments
* Regulatory horizon scanning
* Staff training on security and privacy

Security and compliance are treated as **continuous processes**, not one-time certifications.
